##Overview
The emulation of instruments via audio signal processing is a challenging task and racket provides the tools for
generating and manipulating simple sine waves through several different libraries. These libraries can be used to
create more complex sounds that emulate the characteristics of real life instruments. The Sherman Keyboard will be a
synthesizer that will give the user the ability to program their own complex sounds by adjusting different settings
built into the UI as well as the ability to use interesting pre-configured settings that sound similar to real
instruments.

##Concepts Demonstrated
Identify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. 
* **Data abstraction** is used to provide access to the elements of the RSS feed.
* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**
* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.

##External Technology and Libraries
Briefly describe the existing technology you utilized, and how you used it. Provide a link to that technology(ies).
