{"name":"The Sherman Keyboard","tagline":"Synth Loaf","body":"# The-Sherman-Keyboard\r\n\r\n<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oplS15projects/The-Sherman-Keyboard/master/screenshot.png>\r\n\r\n##Authors\r\n**Stuart Tomkins**\r\n\r\n**Kevin Waco**\r\n\r\n**Eamon Lightning**\r\n\r\n\r\n##Overview\r\nThe emulation of instruments via audio signal processing is a challenging task and racket provides the tools for\r\ngenerating and manipulating simple sine waves through several different libraries. These libraries can be used to\r\ncreate more complex sounds that emulate the characteristics of real life instruments. The Sherman Keyboard will be a\r\nsynthesizer that will give the user the ability to program their own complex sounds by adjusting different settings\r\nbuilt into the UI as well as the ability to use interesting pre-configured settings that sound similar to real\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n##Concepts Demonstrated\r\n* **Object Oriented Programming**: Inheritance is used in creating the different elements of the GUI.\r\n* **Data Abstraction**: abstractions away from the core driver (additive-synth.rkt) by the effects processor allows for easy to generate complex sound waves through the GUI.\r\n* **data mutability**, **local state**: Used to initialize hash tables with musical tones within local frames to keep them persistent in memory.\r\n\r\n##External Technology and Libraries\r\nBriefly describe the existing technology you utilized, and how you used it. Provide a link to that technology(ies).\r\n\r\n[portaudio](http://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/doc/portaudio/index.html)\r\n        Used to play generated samples created by the synth via the s16vec-play procedure. \r\n\r\n[ffi/vector](http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/homogeneous-vectors.html)\r\n        Used for creating sound samples by storing values into an integer buffer\r\n\r\n[racket/gui](http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html?q=racket%20gui)\r\n        Used to create the interactive keyboard and various settings that can adjusted.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Favorite Lines of Code\r\n\r\n####Stu:\r\nThese lines of code are the event handling when the user left clicks a key. When the determine-note-on-click\r\nprocedure is called, it determines what key is pressed on the synth based on the pixel position of the mouse.\r\n```\r\n    (define/override (on-event event)\r\n      (when (send event button-down? 'left)\r\n        (determine-note-on-click event)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Kevin:\r\nThis procedure uses the concepts of **assignment** and **local state** to initialize a hash table with musical tones. The procedure *create-note-hash* creates a computational object with time-varying state. When *create-note-hash* is execute a hash object, provided by racket, is created within a local frame within the global environment. The procedure init is defined and then a lambda procedure is returned. The lambda procedure has access to the the procedure *init* and also access to the hash table that was generated. The procedure *init* uses **tail recursion** to fill a hash table by using a list various musical tones. The user can then send **symbolic data** to execute specific operations on the note-hash created. This allows for **abstraction** away from worrying about how the hash is filled.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  (define (create-note-hash)\r\n    (define note-hash (make-hash))\r\n  \r\n    (define (init freqs timbre attack max-volume num-of-harmonics)\r\n      (if (null? freqs)\r\n        note-hash\r\n        (begin (hash-set! note-hash (car freqs) (create-tone (car freqs)\r\n                                                             timbre\r\n                                                             attack\r\n                                                             max-volume\r\n                                                             num-of-harmonics))\r\n               (init (cdr freqs) timbre attack max-volume num-of-harmonics))))\r\n        \r\n    (lambda (cmd)\r\n      (cond ((eq? cmd 'init) init)\r\n            ((eq? cmd 'play) (lambda (pitch) (hash-ref note-hash pitch))))))\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Eamon:\r\n\r\nThis little snippet of code is the heart of the audio generation process. Individual sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phase offsets are generated and added to an audio vector. When the audio vector is played, these individual sine waves are played simultaneously creating the effect of additive synthesis. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  (define sample1 (real->s16 (* a1 a (sin (+ (* tpisr t (* fundamentalFreq k1)) phase1)))))\r\n  (define sample2 (real->s16 (* a2 a (sin (+ (* tpisr t (* fundamentalFreq k2)) phase2)))))\r\n  (define sample3 (real->s16 (* a3 a (sin (+ (* tpisr t (* fundamentalFreq k3)) phase3)))))\r\n  (define sample4 (real->s16 (* a4 a (sin (+ (* tpisr t (* fundamentalFreq k4)) phase4)))))\r\n  (s16vector-set! vec (* 4 t) sample1)\r\n  (s16vector-set! vec (+ 1 (* 4 t)) sample2)\r\n  (s16vector-set! vec (+ 2 (* 4 t)) sample3)\r\n  (s16vector-set! vec (+ 3 (* 4 t)) sample4))\r\n     \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#How to Download and Run\r\nYou can click the link at the top to download the zipped folder containing our source code.
